## Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles

1. Wheels
It seems that the shape of the wheels is distinctive and can be seen in almost all the cars. So we might be able to use this as a stable feature.

2. Windows and Pillars
There seems to be no point clouds on the window, but pillars have them, and this characteristic makes the cars distinctive.

3. Rectanglar shape
When we see point clouds data form BEV, we can see that almost all the cars have rectanglar-shape. So this charactaristic could be used as a key feature.
